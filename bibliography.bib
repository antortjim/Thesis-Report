abstract = {Variational Bayes (VB), also known as independent mean-field approximation, has become a popular method for Bayesian network inference in recent years. Its application is vast, e.g. in neural network, compressed sensing, clustering, etc. to name just a few. In this paper, the independence constraint in VB will be relaxed to a conditional constraint class, called copula in statistics. Since a joint probability distribution always belongs to a copula class, the novel copula VB (CVB) approximation is a generalized form of VB. Via information geometry, we will see that CVB algorithm iteratively projects the original joint distribution to a copula constraint space until it reaches a local minimum Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. By this way, all mean-field approximations, e.g. iterative VB, Expectation-Maximization (EM), Iterated Conditional Mode (ICM) and k-means algorithms, are special cases of CVB approximation. For a generic Bayesian network, an augmented hierarchy form of CVB will also be designed. While mean-field algorithms can only return a locally optimal approximation for a correlated network, the augmented CVB network, which is an optimally weighted average of a mixture of simpler network structures, can potentially achieve the globally optimal approximation for the first time. Via simulations of Gaussian mixture clustering, the classification's accuracy of CVB will be shown to be far superior to that of state-of-the-art VB, EM and k-means algorithms.},

@article{Hoffman2011,
abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

However, membrane proteomics remains a challenge. One way to bring into view the complex mixture of proteins present in a membrane is to develop proteomic analyses based on (1) the use of highly purified membrane fractions and (2) fractionation of membrane proteins to retrieve as many proteins as possible (from the most to the less hydrophobic ones). To illustrate such strategies, we choose two types of membranes, the plasma membrane and the chloroplast envelope membranes. Both types of membranes can be prepared in a reasonable degree of purity from different types of tissues: the plasma membrane from cultured cells and the chloroplast envelope membrane from whole plants. This article is restricted to the description of methods for the preparation of highly purified and characterized plant membrane fractions and the subsequent fractionation of these membrane proteins according to simple physicochemical criteria (i.e., chloroform/methanol extraction, alkaline or saline treatments) for further analyses using modern proteomic methodologies.},

abstract = {An experimental investigation and theoretical analysis are reported on charge competition in electrospray ionization (ESI) and its effects on the linear dynamic range of ESI mass spectrometric (MS) measurements. The experiments confirmed the expected increase of MS sensitivities as the ESI flow rate decreases. However, different compounds show somewhat different mass spectral peak intensities even at the lowest flow rates, at the same concentration and electrospray operating conditions. MS response for each compound solution shows good linearity at lower concentrations and levels off at high concentration, consistent with analyte "saturation" in the ESI process. The extent of charge competition leading to saturation in the ESI process is consistent with the relative magnitude of excess charge in the electrospray compared to the total number of analyte molecules in the solution. This ESI capacity model allows one to predict the sample concentration limits for charge competition and the on-set of ionization suppression effects, as well as the linear dynamic range for ESI-MS.

@article{Kirik2018,
abstract = {Tandem mass-spectrometry has become the method of choice for high-throughput, quantitative analysis in proteomics. However, since the link between the peptides and the proteins they originate from is typically broken, identification of the analyzed peptides relies on matching of the fragmentation spectra (MS2) to theoretical spectra of possible candidate peptides, often filtered for precursor ion mass. To this end, peptide-spectrum matching algorithms score the concordance between the experimental and the theoretical spectra of candidate peptides, by evaluating the number (or proportion) of theoretically possible fragment ions observed in the experimental spectra, without any discrimination. However, the assumption that each theoretical fragment is just as likely to be observed is inaccurate. On the contrary, MS2 spectra often have few dominant fragments. We propose a novel prediction algorithm based on a hidden Markov model, which allow for the training process to be carried out very efficiently. Using millions of MS/MS spectra generated in our lab, we found an overall good reproducibility across different fragmentation spectra, given the precursor peptide and charge state. This result implies that there is indeed a pattern to fragmentation that justifies using machine learning methods. Furthermore, the overall agreement between spectra of the same peptide at the same charge state serves as an upper limit on how well prediction algorithms can be expected to perform. We have investigated the performance of a third order HMM model, trained on several million MS2 spectra, in various ways. Compared to a mock model, in which the fragment ions and their intensities are shuffled, we see a clear difference in prediction accuracy using our model. This result indicates that our model can pick up meaningful patterns, i.e. we can indeed learn the fragmentation process. Secondly, looking at the variability of the prediction performance by varying the train/test data split, in a K-fold cross validation scheme, we observed an overall robust model that performs well independent of the specific peptides that are present in the training data. Last but not least, we propose that the real value of this model is as a pre-processing step in the peptide identification process, by discerning fragment ions that are unlikely to be intense for a given candidate peptide, rather than using the actual predicted intensities. As such, probabilistic measures of concordance between experimental and theoretical spectra, would leverage better statistics.},

abstract = {Peptide intensities from mass spectra are increasingly used for relative quantitation of proteins in complex samples. However, numerous issues inherent to the mass spectrometry workflow turn quantitative proteomic data analysis into a crucial challenge. We and others have shown that modeling at the peptide level outperforms classical summarization-based approaches, which typically also discard a lot of proteins at the data preprocessing step. Peptide-based linear regression models, however, still suffer from unbalanced datasets due to missing peptide intensities, outlying peptide intensities and overfitting. Here, we further improve upon peptide-based models by three modular extensions: ridge regression, improved variance estimation by borrowing information across proteins with empirical Bayes and M-estimation with Huber weights. We illustrate our method on the CPTAC spike-in study and on a study comparing wild-type and ArgP knock-out Francisella tularensis proteomes. We show that the fold change estimates of our robust approach are more precise and more accurate than those from state-of-the-art summarization-based methods and peptide-based regression models, which leads to an improved sensitivity and specificity. We also demonstrate that ionization competition effects come already into play at very low spike-in concentrations and confirm that analyses with peptide-based regression methods on peptide intensity values aggregated by charge state and modification status (e.g. MaxQuant's peptides.txt file) are slightly superior to analyses on raw peptide intensity values (e.g. MaxQuant's evidence.txt file).},

abstract = {This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of the peptide and protein identification process using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data generated in shotgun proteomic experiments. The commonly used methods for assigning peptide sequences to MS/MS spectra are critically discussed and compared, from basic strategies to advanced multi-stage approaches. A particular attention is paid to the problem of false-positive identifications. Existing statistical approaches for assessing the significance of peptide to spectrum matches are surveyed, ranging from single-spectrum approaches such as expectation values to global error rate estimation procedures such as false discovery rates and posterior probabilities. The importance of using auxiliary discriminant information (mass accuracy, peptide separation coordinates, digestion properties, and etc.) is discussed, and advanced computational approaches for joint modeling of multiple sources of information are presented. This review also includes a detailed analysis of the issues affecting the interpretation of data at the protein level, including the amplification of error rates when going from peptide to protein level, and the ambiguities in inferring the identifies of sample proteins in the presence of shared peptides. Commonly used methods for computing protein-level confidence scores are discussed in detail. The review concludes with a discussion of several outstanding computational issues.},

abstract = {Quantitative label-free mass spectrometry is increasingly used to analyze the proteomes of complex biological samples. However, the choice of appropriate data analysis methods remains a major challenge. We therefore provide a rigorous comparison between peptide-based models and peptide-summarization-based pipelines. We show that peptide-based models outperform summarization-based pipelines in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision. We also demonstrate that the predefined FDR cutoffs for the detection of differentially regulated proteins can become problematic when differentially expressed (DE) proteins are highly abundant in one or more samples. Care should therefore be taken when data are interpreted from samples with spiked-in internal controls and from samples that contain a few very highly abundant proteins. We do, however, show that specific diagnostic plots can be used for assessing differentially expressed proteins and the overall quality of the obtained fold change estimates. Finally, our study also illustrates that imputation under the “missing by low abundance” assumption is beneficial for the detection of differential expression in proteins with low abundance, but it negatively affects moderately to highly abundant proteins. Hence, imputation strategies that are commonly implemented in standard proteomics software should be used with care.},

abstract = {Label-free shotgun proteomics is routinely used to assess proteomes. However, extracting relevant information from the massive amounts of generated data remains difficult. This tutorial provides a strong foundation on analysis of quantitative proteomics data. We provide key statistical concepts that help researchers to design proteomics experiments and we showcase how to analyze quantitative proteomics data using our recent free and open-source R package MSqRob, which was developed to implement the peptide-level robust ridge regression method for relative protein quantification described by Goeminne et al. MSqRob can handle virtually any experimental proteomics design and outputs proteins ordered by statistical significance. Moreover, its graphical user interface and interactive diagnostic plots provide easy inspection and also detection of anomalies in the data and flaws in the data analysis, allowing deeper assessment of the validity of results and a critical review of the experimental design. Our tutorial discusses interactive preprocessing, data analysis and visualization of label-free MS-based quantitative proteomics experiments with simple and more complex designs. We provide well-documented scripts to run analyses in bash mode on GitHub, enabling the integration of MSqRob in automated pipelines on cluster environments (https://github.com/statOmics/MSqRob). Significance The concepts outlined in this tutorial aid in designing better experiments and analyzing the resulting data more appropriately. The two case studies using the MSqRob graphical user interface will contribute to a wider adaptation of advanced peptide-based models, resulting in higher quality data analysis workflows and more reproducible results in the proteomics community. We also provide well-documented scripts for experienced users that aim at automating MSqRob on cluster environments.},

@article{Marshall2013,
abstract = {Accurate mass measurement requires the highest possible mass resolution, to ensure that only a single elemental composition contributes to the mass spectral peak in question. Although mass resolution is conventionally defined as the closest distinguishable separation between two peaks of equal height and width, the required mass resolving power can be ∼10× higher for equal width peaks whose peak height ratio is 100 : 1. Ergo, minimum resolving power requires specification of maximum dynamic range, and is thus 10–100× higher than the conventional definition. Mass resolving power also depends on mass-to-charge ratio. Mass accuracy depends on mass spectral signal-to-noise ratio and digital resolution. Finally, the reliability of elemental composition assignment can be improved by resolution of isotopic fine structure. Thus, the answer to the question of “how much is enough mass resolving power” requires that one first specify S/N ratio, dynamic range, digital resolution, mass-to-charge ratio, and (if available) isotopic fine structure. The highest available broadband mass resolving power and mass accuracy is from Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Over the past five years, FT-ICR MS mass accuracy has improved by about an order of magnitude, based on higher magnetic field strength, conditional averaging of time-domain transients, better mass calibration (spectral segmentation; inclusion of a space charge term); radially dispersed excitation; phase correction to yield absorption-mode display; and new ICR cell segmentation designs.},

abstract = {Replicate mass spectrometry (MS) measurements and the use of multiple analytical methods can greatly expand the comprehensiveness of shotgun proteomic profiling of biological samples. However, the inherent biases and variations in such data create computational and statistical challenges for quantitative comparative analysis. We developed and tested a normalized, label-free quantitative method termed the normalized spectral index (SI(N)), which combines three MS abundance features: peptide count, spectral count and fragment-ion (tandem MS or MS/MS) intensity. SI(N) largely eliminated variances between replicate MS measurements, permitting quantitative reproducibility and highly significant quantification of thousands of proteins detected in replicate MS measurements of the same and distinct samples. It accurately predicts protein abundance more often than the five other methods we tested. Comparative immunoblotting and densitometry further validate our method. Comparative quantification of complex data sets from multiple shotgun proteomics measurements is relevant for systems biology and biomarker discovery.},

These proteins and their disordered segments have functionally interesting properties and provide novel challenges for the biophysical techniques that are used to study them. This chapter focuses on computational approaches to predicting such regions and analyzing the functions linked to them, and has implications for protein scientists who wish to study such properties as molecular recognition and post-translational modifications.

abstract = {Protein quantification without isotopic labels has been a long-standing interest in the proteomics field. However, accurate and robust proteome-wide quantification with label-free approaches remains a challenge. We developed a new intensity determination and normalization procedure called MaxLFQ that is fully compatible with any peptide or protein separation prior to LC-MS analysis. Protein abundance profiles are assembled using the maximum possible information from MS-signals given that the presence of quantifiable peptides varies from sample to sample. On a benchmark dataset with two proteomes mixed at known ratios, we accurately detect the mixing ratio over the entire protein expression range, with higher precision for abundant proteins. The significance of individual label-free quantifications is obtained by a t-test approach. On a second benchmark dataset, we accurately quantify fold changes over several orders of magnitudes, a task that is challenging with label-based methods. MaxLFQ is a generic label-free quantification technology that is readily applicable to tackle many biological questions and it is compatible with standard statistical analysis workflows, and it has been validated in many and diverse biological projects. Our algorithms can handle very large experiments of 500+ samples in manageable computing time. It is implemented in the freely-available MaxQuant computational proteomics platform and works completely seamlessly at the click of a button (www.maxquant.org).},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is commonly used to identify and quantify the hundreds to thousands of proteins that are present in complex biological samples. Widespread data sharing via publicly accessible repositories, such as PRIDE, has now become standard practice, aided by robust user-oriented tools for data submission and inspection and bolstered by the advent of the ProteomeXchange initiative. Importantly, repository data sharing has enabled the first high-profile studies in which the repurposing of publicly available proteomics data has revealed new biological insights.$\backslash$nHowever, proteomics data processing and (re-)analysis currently remain far from routine practice. There is a pressing need for a user-friendly, open source tool that empowers users to carry out state-of-the-art proteomics data analysis at any stage in the data life cycle. To maximize the value of public proteomics data, reuse and repurposing must become straightforward, allowing the completion of the proteomics data cycle. Here we describe PeptideShaker (http://peptide-shaker.googlecode.com), a proteomics informatics software that can be used at any stage in the proteomics data cycle for the analysis and interpretation of primary data, enabling data sharing and dissemination and re-analysis of publicly available proteomics data. Importantly, PeptideShaker can work with the combined output of multiple identification algorithms.},

abstract = {The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, known as the AUC, is currently considered to be the standard method to assess the accuracy of predictive distribution models. It avoids the supposed subjectivity in the threshold selection process, when continuous probability derived scores are converted to a binary presence–absence variable, by summarizing overall model performance over all possible thresholds. In this manuscript we review some of the features of this measure and bring into question its reliability as a comparative measure of accuracy between model results. We do not recommend using AUC for five reasons: (1) it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness-of-fit of the model; (2) it summarises the test performance over regions of the ROC space in which one would rarely operate; (3) it weights omission and commission errors equally; (4) it does not give information about the spatial distribution of model errors; and, most importantly, (5) the total extent to which models are carried out highly influences the rate of well-predicted absences and the AUC scores.},

abstract = {It is known that the learning rate is the most important hyper-parameter to tune for training deep neural networks. This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate "reasonable bounds" -- linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets, and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures. These are practical tools for everyone who trains neural networks.},

Although the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the disease are not fully elucidated, it is known that genetic susceptibility and environmental factors trigger an abnormal autoimmune response. Potentially, any organ and tissue could be affected by RA and the increased cardiovascular (CV) risk represents the major complication responsible for a worse prognosis. In this setting, the shared pathogenic mechanisms between RA pathogenesis and accelerated atherosclerosis further strengthen the rationale for a treat-to-target strategy with synthetic and biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by gradual joint destruction. Tocilizumab (TCZ) significantly suppresses symptoms, however not all patients are protected from joint damage. We investigated whether early measurement of specific biomarkers could predict early joint protection response to tocilizumab.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Serum biomarkers (CRPM, VICM, C1M, C2M, C3M (MMP-degraded CRP, vimentin type I, II and III collagen), CTX-I/OC (bone turnover), and CRP) were measured in 740 RA patients (the LITHE study) treated with Placebo, or 4 or 8 mg/kg TCZ. Early responders were those with ≥20{\%} improvement in SJC or TJC by week 16. The biomarkers' predictability of response was investigated by AUROC and classification regression tree analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The best biomarker predictability for identification of TCZ responders were; baseline CTX-I/OC (AUC 0.66, p = 0.0005) and changes in C1M (AUC 0.67, p = 0.0072), C2M (AUC 0.72, p = 0.0002), C3M (AUC 0.63, p = 0.018) and the combination of biomarkers (AUC 0.81, p = 0.0025). Patients with high bone turnover (CTX-I/OC) and low C2M were 6.8-fold (p = 0.003) more likely to have an early response to TCZ.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This enhanced pharmacodynamic (PD) response enabled identification of early responders with a superior TCZ clinical benefit. This biomarker model may assist in the identification of TCZ responsive RA patients and thus potentially benefit individual patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00106535 .

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Remission is an important goal of therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but data on duration of remission are lacking. Our objective was to describe the duration of remission in RA, assessed by different criteria.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We evaluated patients from the Brigham and Women's Rheumatoid Arthritis Sequential Study (BRASS) not in remission at baseline with at least 2 years of follow-up. Remission was assessed according to the Disease Activity Score 28-C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP4), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores, and the recently proposed American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for remission. Analyses were performed by using Kaplan-Meier survival curves.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We identified 871 subjects with ≥ 2 years of follow-up. Of these subjects, 394 were in remission at one or more time-points and not in remission at baseline, according to at least one of the following criteria: DAS28-CRP {\textless} 2.6 (n = 309), DAS28-CRP {\textless} 2.3 (n = 275), SDAI (n = 168), CDAI (n = 170), and 2010 ACR/EULAR (n = 158). The median age for the 394 subjects at entrance to BRASS was 56 years; median disease duration was 8 years; 81{\%} were female patients; and 72{\%} were seropositive. Survival analysis performed separately for each remission criterion demonstrated that {\textless} 50{\%} of subjects remained in remission 1 year later. Median remission survival time was 1 year. Kaplan-Meier curves of the various remission criteria did not significantly differ (P = 0.29 according to the log-rank test).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in clinical practice, a minority of RA patients are in sustained remission.},

abstract = {24 and Maarten Boers 5 This criteria set has been approved by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Board of Directors and the Euro-pean League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Executive Committee as Provisional. This signifies that the criteria set has been quantitatively validated using patient data, but it has not undergone validation based on an external data set. All ACR/EULAR-approved criteria sets are expected to undergo intermittent updates. The American College of Rheumatology is an independent, professional, medical and scientific society which does not guarantee, warrant, or endorse any commercial product or service. Objective. Remission in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an increasingly attainable goal, but there is no widely used definition of remission that is stringent but achievable and could be applied uniformly as an out-come measure in clinical trials. This work was under-taken to develop such a definition. Methods. A committee consisting of members of the American College of Rheumatology, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the Outcome Mea-sures in Rheumatology Initiative met to guide the process and review prespecified analyses from RA clin-ical trials. The committee requested a stringent defini-tion (little, if any, active disease) and decided to use core set measures including, as a minimum, joint counts and levels of an acute-phase reactant to define remission. Members were surveyed to select the level of each core set measure that would be consistent with remission. Candidate definitions of remission were tested, includ-ing those that constituted a number of individual mea-sures of remission (Boolean approach) as well as defi-nitions using disease activity indexes. To select a definition of remission, trial data were analyzed to examine the added contribution of patient-reported outcomes and the ability of candidate measures to predict later good radiographic and functional outcomes.},

Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model.
