@article{Marshall2013,
abstract = {Accurate mass measurement requires the highest possible mass resolution, to ensure that only a single elemental composition contributes to the mass spectral peak in question. Although mass resolution is conventionally defined as the closest distinguishable separation between two peaks of equal height and width, the required mass resolving power can be ∼10× higher for equal width peaks whose peak height ratio is 100 : 1. Ergo, minimum resolving power requires specification of maximum dynamic range, and is thus 10–100× higher than the conventional definition. Mass resolving power also depends on mass-to-charge ratio. Mass accuracy depends on mass spectral signal-to-noise ratio and digital resolution. Finally, the reliability of elemental composition assignment can be improved by resolution of isotopic fine structure. Thus, the answer to the question of “how much is enough mass resolving power” requires that one first specify S/N ratio, dynamic range, digital resolution, mass-to-charge ratio, and (if available) isotopic fine structure. The highest available broadband mass resolving power and mass accuracy is from Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Over the past five years, FT-ICR MS mass accuracy has improved by about an order of magnitude, based on higher magnetic field strength, conditional averaging of time-domain transients, better mass calibration (spectral segmentation; inclusion of a space charge term); radially dispersed excitation; phase correction to yield absorption-mode display; and new ICR cell segmentation designs.},

abstract = {Replicate mass spectrometry (MS) measurements and the use of multiple analytical methods can greatly expand the comprehensiveness of shotgun proteomic profiling of biological samples. However, the inherent biases and variations in such data create computational and statistical challenges for quantitative comparative analysis. We developed and tested a normalized, label-free quantitative method termed the normalized spectral index (SI(N)), which combines three MS abundance features: peptide count, spectral count and fragment-ion (tandem MS or MS/MS) intensity. SI(N) largely eliminated variances between replicate MS measurements, permitting quantitative reproducibility and highly significant quantification of thousands of proteins detected in replicate MS measurements of the same and distinct samples. It accurately predicts protein abundance more often than the five other methods we tested. Comparative immunoblotting and densitometry further validate our method. Comparative quantification of complex data sets from multiple shotgun proteomics measurements is relevant for systems biology and biomarker discovery.},

There are many different search engines, both commercial and open source, each employing a somewhat different technique for spectrum identification. The set of high-scoring peptide-spectrum matches for a defined set of input spectra differs markedly among the various search engine results; individual engines each provide unique correct identifications among a core set of correlative identifications. This has led to the approach of combining the results from multiple search engines to achieve improved analysis of each dataset.

We benchmark MS-GF þ using diverse spectral data sets: (i) spectra of varying fragmentation methods; (ii) spectra of multiple enzyme digests; (iii) spectra of phosphorylated peptides; and (iv) spectra of peptides with unusual fragmentation propensities produced by a novel alpha-lytic protease. For all these data sets, MS-GF þ significantly increases the number of identified peptides compared with commonly used methods for peptide identifications.

abstract = {Protein quantification without isotopic labels has been a long-standing interest in the proteomics field. However, accurate and robust proteome-wide quantification with label-free approaches remains a challenge. We developed a new intensity determination and normalization procedure called MaxLFQ that is fully compatible with any peptide or protein separation prior to LC-MS analysis. Protein abundance profiles are assembled using the maximum possible information from MS-signals given that the presence of quantifiable peptides varies from sample to sample. On a benchmark dataset with two proteomes mixed at known ratios, we accurately detect the mixing ratio over the entire protein expression range, with higher precision for abundant proteins. The significance of individual label-free quantifications is obtained by a t-test approach. On a second benchmark dataset, we accurately quantify fold changes over several orders of magnitudes, a task that is challenging with label-based methods. MaxLFQ is a generic label-free quantification technology that is readily applicable to tackle many biological questions and it is compatible with standard statistical analysis workflows, and it has been validated in many and diverse biological projects. Our algorithms can handle very large experiments of 500+ samples in manageable computing time. It is implemented in the freely-available MaxQuant computational proteomics platform and works completely seamlessly at the click of a button (www.maxquant.org).},

We do not recommend using AUC for five reasons: (1) it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness-of-fit of the model; (2) it summarises the test performance over regions of the ROC space in which one would rarely operate; (3) it weights omission and commission errors equally; (4) it does not give information about the spatial distribution of model errors; and, most importantly, (5) the total extent to which models are carried out highly influences the rate of well-predicted absences and the AUC scores.},

This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate "reasonable bounds" -- linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets, and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by gradual joint destruction. Tocilizumab (TCZ) significantly suppresses symptoms, however not all patients are protected from joint damage. We investigated whether early measurement of specific biomarkers could predict early joint protection response to tocilizumab.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Serum biomarkers (CRPM, VICM, C1M, C2M, C3M (MMP-degraded CRP, vimentin type I, II and III collagen), CTX-I/OC (bone turnover), and CRP) were measured in 740 RA patients (the LITHE study) treated with Placebo, or 4 or 8 mg/kg TCZ. Early responders were those with ≥20{\%} improvement in SJC or TJC by week 16. The biomarkers' predictability of response was investigated by AUROC and classification regression tree analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The best biomarker predictability for identification of TCZ responders were; baseline CTX-I/OC (AUC 0.66, p = 0.0005) and changes in C1M (AUC 0.67, p = 0.0072), C2M (AUC 0.72, p = 0.0002), C3M (AUC 0.63, p = 0.018) and the combination of biomarkers (AUC 0.81, p = 0.0025). Patients with high bone turnover (CTX-I/OC) and low C2M were 6.8-fold (p = 0.003) more likely to have an early response to TCZ.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This enhanced pharmacodynamic (PD) response enabled identification of early responders with a superior TCZ clinical benefit. This biomarker model may assist in the identification of TCZ responsive RA patients and thus potentially benefit individual patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00106535 .

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Remission is an important goal of therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but data on duration of remission are lacking. Our objective was to describe the duration of remission in RA, assessed by different criteria.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We evaluated patients from the Brigham and Women's Rheumatoid Arthritis Sequential Study (BRASS) not in remission at baseline with at least 2 years of follow-up. Remission was assessed according to the Disease Activity Score 28-C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP4), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores, and the recently proposed American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for remission. Analyses were performed by using Kaplan-Meier survival curves.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We identified 871 subjects with ≥ 2 years of follow-up. Of these subjects, 394 were in remission at one or more time-points and not in remission at baseline, according to at least one of the following criteria: DAS28-CRP {\textless} 2.6 (n = 309), DAS28-CRP {\textless} 2.3 (n = 275), SDAI (n = 168), CDAI (n = 170), and 2010 ACR/EULAR (n = 158). The median age for the 394 subjects at entrance to BRASS was 56 years; median disease duration was 8 years; 81{\%} were female patients; and 72{\%} were seropositive. Survival analysis performed separately for each remission criterion demonstrated that {\textless} 50{\%} of subjects remained in remission 1 year later. Median remission survival time was 1 year. Kaplan-Meier curves of the various remission criteria did not significantly differ (P = 0.29 according to the log-rank test).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in clinical practice, a minority of RA patients are in sustained remission.},

abstract = {24 and Maarten Boers 5 This criteria set has been approved by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Board of Directors and the Euro-pean League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Executive Committee as Provisional. This signifies that the criteria set has been quantitatively validated using patient data, but it has not undergone validation based on an external data set. All ACR/EULAR-approved criteria sets are expected to undergo intermittent updates. The American College of Rheumatology is an independent, professional, medical and scientific society which does not guarantee, warrant, or endorse any commercial product or service. Objective. Remission in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an increasingly attainable goal, but there is no widely used definition of remission that is stringent but achievable and could be applied uniformly as an out-come measure in clinical trials. This work was under-taken to develop such a definition. Methods. A committee consisting of members of the American College of Rheumatology, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the Outcome Mea-sures in Rheumatology Initiative met to guide the process and review prespecified analyses from RA clin-ical trials. The committee requested a stringent defini-tion (little, if any, active disease) and decided to use core set measures including, as a minimum, joint counts and levels of an acute-phase reactant to define remission. Members were surveyed to select the level of each core set measure that would be consistent with remission. Candidate definitions of remission were tested, includ-ing those that constituted a number of individual mea-sures of remission (Boolean approach) as well as defi-nitions using disease activity indexes. To select a definition of remission, trial data were analyzed to examine the added contribution of patient-reported outcomes and the ability of candidate measures to predict later good radiographic and functional outcomes.},
