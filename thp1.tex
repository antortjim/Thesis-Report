\chapter{Pipeline benchmarking on \ac{NZ} data}
\label{chap:benchmark}

\section*{Summary}

A benchmark dataset generated by \ac{NZ} technicians was run through the pipeline presented in chapter \ref{chap:pipeline} to showcase its performance. The experiment consisted of the application of two different treatments to THP-1 cell cultures. One group was subjected to an experimental procedure triggering the immunological response, while the other group was subjected to a negative control. The analysis of the resulting dataset through the aforementioned pipeline should thus reflect a change in the protein profile corresponding to an activation of the immune system in the first group when compared to the second. The results confirmed that the computational analysis successfully captured this response. It was concluded that the software can be used in future experiments where the expected biological phenomena is not known.
